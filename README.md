# UccML

## From-Scratch Machine Learning Library

A lightweight Python library implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch, designed for learning, experimentation, and research. All algorithms are implemented without relying on external ML libraries like scikit-learn, giving you full control over the internals.

## Features

### SVM (Support Vector Machine)

Soft-margin or hard-margin control via C

Supports multiple kernel functions (linear, polynomial, RBF, and custom)

Gradient-based optimization with a general-purpose optimizer

### Decision Tree

Supports classification (regression *pending*)

Pruning methods (forward, backward) *pending*

Supports multiple Feature Selection Criterion (Gini, information gain, gain ratio)

Full tree construction from scratch, with explainable logic

### General-purpose Optimizers

Gradient Descent (GD)

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) *pending*

Quadratic Programming (QP) *pending*

Expectation Maximization(EM) *pending*

Designed to be reusable across different algorithms
